# Pokemon Battle Companion

## Purpose
This **React Vite** application fetches and displays **Pokemon types, stats, and damage relations** using the **PokeAPI**. It provides an interactive and responsive UI for Pokemon data exploration.

### Problem Statement
As a Pokemon enthusiast who loves to battle, I want a simple website to compare Pokemon types and receive Pokemon recommendations, so that I can maximize my chances of winning.

Given that type match-ups play a crucial role in battles, when I compare a Pokemon type, then I should receive clear and concise information about its strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness, as well as a list of recommended Pokemon that have a strong advantage against it.

## Features

- Fetch Pokemon details using **PokeAPI**
- Display **Pokemon and Pokemon Types**
- Show **base stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
- View **damage relations** (Strong Against, Weak Against, Neutral) by type
